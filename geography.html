            <p>The geography of New York City is characterized by its coastal position 
            at the meeting of the Hudson River and the Atlantic Ocean in a naturally sheltered harbor. 
            The city's geography, with its scarce availability of land, is a contributing factor in 
            making it one of the most densely populated cities in the United States. Environmental 
            issues are chiefly concerned with managing this density, which also explains why New York 
            is among the most energy efficient and least automobile-dependent cities in the United States. 
            The city's climate is temperate.</p>

            <div class="fourup">
                <p>New York City is located on the coast of the Northeastern United States at the mouth of 
                the Hudson River in southeastern New York state. It is located in the New Yorkâ€“New Jersey Harbor Estuary,
                the centerpiece of which is the New York Harbor, whose deep waters and sheltered bays helped the city
                grow in significance as a trading city. Much of New York is built on the three islands of Manhattan, 
                Staten Island, and western Long Island, making land scarce and encouraging a high population densit.</p>

                <p>The Hudson River flows from the Hudson Valley into New York Bay, becoming a tidal estuary that separates 
                the Bronx and Manhattan from Northern New Jersey. The Harlem River, another tidal strait between the East 
                and Hudson Rivers, separates Manhattan from the Bronx.</p>
                
                

                <p>The boroughs of New York City straddle the border between two geologic provinces of eastern North America. 
                Brooklyn and Queens, located on Long Island, are part of the eastern coastal plain. Long Island is a massive 
                moraine which formed at the southern fringe of the Laurentide Ice Sheet during the last Ice Age. The Bronx 
                and Manhattan lie on the eastern edge of the Newark Basin, a block of the Earth's crust which sank downward 
                during the disintegration of the supercontinent Pangaea during the Triassic period. The Palisades Sill on 
                the New Jersey shore of the Hudson River exposes ancient, once-molten rock that filled the basin. 
                Tough metamorphic rocks underlie much of Manhattan, providing solid support for its many skyscrapers.</p>

                <p>The city's land has been altered considerably by human intervention, with substantial land reclamation 
                along the waterfronts since Dutch colonial times. Reclamation is most notable in Lower Manhattan with
                modern developments like Battery Park City. Much of the natural variations in topography have been evened out, 
                particularly in Manhattan.[1] The West Side of Manhattan retains some hilliness, especially in Upper Manhattan, 
                while the East Side has been considerably flattened. Duffy's Hill in East Harlem is one notable exception to the 
                East Side's relatively level grade.</p>
                
                


                <p>The city's land area is estimated to be 321 square miles (830 km2).[2] However, a more recent estimate calculates 
                a total land area of 304.8 square miles (789.4 square kilometres).[3] The highest natural point in the city is Todt 
                Hill on Staten Island, which at 409.8 ft (124.9 m) above sea level is the highest hill on the Eastern Seaboard south 
                of Maine. The summit of the ridge is largely covered in woodlands as part of the Staten Island Greenbelt.</p>
